description: A control that allows the user to toggle between checked, unchecked, and indeterminate states. Built on Radix UI Checkbox primitives.
---

Checkboxes let users select one or more options from a set, or toggle a single option on or off. They support three visual states: unchecked, checked, and indeterminate.

## When to use

- To let users select multiple options from a list
- To toggle a single boolean setting (e.g. "Remember me")
- To represent a parent/child selection hierarchy with an indeterminate state

Checkboxes should always have a visible label. If the label is not adjacent, use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to ensure accessibility.
