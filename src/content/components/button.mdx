Buttons are used to trigger actions or navigate within the interface. They communicate the action that will occur when the user interacts with them.

## When to use

- To trigger an action (submit, save, delete)
- To navigate within a flow (next step, continue)
- As a call-to-action

The Button component supports 10 visual variants, 7 size options, and works with leading/trailing icons. Special variants are available for dark backgrounds and footer sections.
