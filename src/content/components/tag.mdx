Tags are compact, non-interactive labels for metadata and categorization.

## When to use

- Showing compact metadata like category, level, or status
- Displaying semantic labels with color coding
- Constrained layouts where label truncation is required

Tag supports color themes (`red | purple | green | blue | orange | grey`), darker surface tone, grey inverted style, and optional truncation behavior.
