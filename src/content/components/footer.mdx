title: Footer
description: Responsive footer with call-to-action, grouped links, legal area, and social links.
---

Footer closes the page with key navigation, legal content, and conversion support.

## When to use

- Product and marketing pages that require global footer navigation
- Layouts where legal and compliance links must remain visible
- Pages that need a final conversion call-to-action before exit

Keep link groups concise and avoid duplicating the full top navigation structure.
