description: Text input field for forms with Figma-matched sizes and states, including helper and error messaging.
---

The Text input component is a styled text field for capturing user data. It supports `small | medium | large` sizes and the visual states `enabled | hover | pressed | disabled | error | read-only`.

## When to use

- Collecting text-based user input (names, emails, searches)
- Form fields that require single-line text entry
- Scenarios that need helper text or explicit error messaging

Use clear labels and concise helper text. For validation failures, use the error state and an explicit error message.
