Dropdown lets users pick one option from a list. It supports `small | medium` sizes, `default | inline` styles, and visual states for static documentation and QA.

## When to use

- Selecting one value from a finite list
- Compact inline form controls in toolbars or dense layouts
- Inputs that need open/closed visual variants with single-option selection

Use clear labels and keep option text concise. For dense interfaces, use the inline style; for forms, use the default style with helper text.
