Cards are containers that group related content and actions. They provide visual separation and help organize information into digestible sections.

## When to use

- Grouping related content (profiles, summaries, settings)
- Displaying items in a grid or list layout
- Creating forms or dialogs within a page
- Showing preview content with actions

Cards consist of optional sub-components: CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent, and CardFooter. Mix and match as needed.
