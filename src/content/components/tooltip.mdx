title: Tooltip
description: Contextual text label that appears on hover or focus to describe an element. Built on Radix UI Tooltip primitives.
---

Tooltips display brief, informative text when users hover over or focus on an element. They help describe unlabelled controls or provide supplementary information without cluttering the interface.

## When to use

- To describe icon-only buttons or controls that lack a visible label
- To provide supplementary context for a UI element
- To show the full text of a truncated string

Tooltips should **never** contain essential information that the user must act on. Use a Popover or inline text instead for critical content.
