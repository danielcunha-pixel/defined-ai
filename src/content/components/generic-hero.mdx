The Generic Hero is the top-most section of a marketing or product page. It establishes context, communicates the core value proposition, and drives users toward a primary action.

## When to use

- As the opening section of landing pages, product pages, or feature pages
- When the page needs a strong visual statement paired with a primary call-to-action
- When an illustrative panel reinforces the message without competing with the copy
