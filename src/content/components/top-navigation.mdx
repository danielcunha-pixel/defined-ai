Top navigation provides the primary entry points for high-level areas of the product.

## When to use

- Product and marketing pages with multiple top-level destinations
- Layouts that need persistent global navigation and quick account actions
- Desktop-first navigation patterns with responsive mobile fallback

Keep labels short and prioritize no more than 4-6 top-level links.
